          Once you schedule your consultation, we will arrive at your business
          in person or create a zoom call. From there, our team will create a
          picture of what your current process performs while taking notes along
          the way. We will interview key players in various departments and work
          to understand the lifecycle of your product or service from the bottom
          up.


          Once the interview stage completes, we will meet with your leadership
          team and discuss immediate pinch points and initial findings. We will
          then depart your facility or call and spend the next 24-48 hours
          developing a road map for your business to optimize the areas we've
          consulted and present our findings, suggestions, and SOP write ups to
          your leadership team for implementation.

          From start to finish, our method of consulting will take about 1-2
          hours of your time.


          We will work quickly to establish an overview of your processes,
          interview key personnel, and let you know the timeframe we will need
          to complete our handoff packet.


          24-48 hours after our meeting, you will receive a packet of
          information outlining our findings, suggestions, and all SOP write ups
          for implementation.


          If you require less time than 1 hour, we are happy to accommodate your
          needs and only request that you gather your personnel in preparation
          to expedite the consult.


          If you require more time than 2 hours, we are happy to accommodate
          your request. However, after 2 hours, we do charge an hourly rate of
          $85. 


          We are more than happy to negotiate consultations in excess of 1 full
          day, but ask you send us an email in advance.
